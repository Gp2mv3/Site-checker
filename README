This is an utility to watch websites, when a page is modified, it can send you an email.
You can watch every site (I hope).

If you see bugs or error, please open a ticket.
This program is under development and of course, it's free so feel free to contribute.


INSTALL:
You need libcurl to compile it.
Install libcurl4-gnutls-dev.

To install Site-checker just type "make" in the directory, an executable will be created (checker).


HOW TO USE:
You must execute ./checker to check the modifications of the watched pages.

The list of the websites you are watching is in address.lst. You must write one address per line and you can add email address like this:
http://www.google.com|gp2mv3@localhost

This line will watch google.com and if the page change, it will send an email to gp2mv3@localhost.

The emails are sent with the command tool mail in unix so mail must be installed to send emails.

To check the site periodically, you can use cron.
